		<h2> Input Device </h2>
			<p> An input device is a type of electronic device that turns, commonly, physical stimulus and interactions into 0's and 1's. When a user presses a key on their keyboard it sends a specific string of 0's and 1's for the comnputer to execute that pressed key. Examples of input devices are your keyboard and mouse, or also camera and microphone. </p>

		<h2> Output Device </h2>
		<img src="output.jpg" width="280px" class="left">
			<p> An output device is an electronic device that turns 0's and 1's into hardware physical products or actions. A common household output device would be the printer, as it receives the information in 0's and 1's and turns it in to the product of a written document. Other examples of output devices are speakers and headphones, or also the screen on your phone. </p>

		<h2> Central Processing Unit </h2>
		<img src="cpu.jpg" width="280px" class="bottomright">
			<p> A CPU, standing for central processing unit is divided into two parts, the arithmetic logic unit and the control unit. Working together these two units perform the core functions of a computer. CPU's are made up of transistors that are organized into the different kinds of logic gates. </p>
	</div>

	<a name="alu"> </a>
	<div class="two">
		<h2> Arithmetic Logic Unit </h2>
		<img src="alu.png" width="225px" class="left">
			<p> The ALU, short for arithmetic logic unit is one part of the central processing unit that does all the math and calculations. It gets instructions from the control unit and executes the math. </p>
	</div>

	<a name="control"> </a>
	<div class="one">
		<h2> Control Unit </h2>
			<img src="control.jpg" width="225px" class="left">
			<p> The control unit is the other half of the cnetral processing unit that deals with more with the logic portion of computers. The control unit is the portion of the CPU that executes the instructions. </p>

	<div class="two">
		<h2> Random Access Memory </h2>
		<img src="ram.jpg" width="400px" class="bottomright">
			<p> The RAM, short for random access memory is the quick "working" memory of a computer. Random access memory is the memory that is usesd when you're running programs because it's very quick and easy to receive. In most everyday computer systems 16GB of RAM is what people lean towards, but if you do a lot of work with taxing programs such as photoshop, or things that require a lot of rendering you see them with 32GB of RAM because they need more of the quick memory to aid their work. </p>

	<a name="optical"> </a>
	<div class="one">
		<h2> Optical Memory </h2>
		<img src="optical.jpg" width="350px" class="left">
			<p> Optical memory is a type of secondary memory. These types of secondary memories are mainly to store information that you don't use too often, such as old pictures or old documents. Optical memory is memory that has been written into it a by a laser. The most common optical memory today is probably a CD or a DVD. The laser puts bumps into these discs and the computer reads them as infromation in either 0's or 1's. </p>
	</div>

	<a name="magnetic"> </a>
	<div class="two">
		<img src="magnetic.jpg" width="350px">
		<h2> Magnetic Memory </h2>
			<p> Magnetic memory is another type of secondary memory. This type of memory is, as the name suggests, using magnets to convey 0's and 1's. Depending on the magnetism each small section it relays information to the CPU. Magnetic storage is very long lasting and also waterproof. Some examples of magnetic memory is a hardrive or a floppy disk. </p>

	<a name="flash"> </a>
	<div class="one">
		<h2> Flash Memory </h2>
		<img src="flash.jpg" width="350px" class="bottomright">
			<p> Flash memory is altered and erased electronically. This is another type of secondary external memory. It's commonly seen as USB sticks and is one of the most portable types of memory as it's compact. Another type of flash memory would be an SD card. </p>
	</div>

	<a name="logic"> </a>
	<div class="two">
		<h2> Logic Gates </h2>
		<img src="logic.png" width="320px" class="left">
			<p> A logic gate is an alectronic circuit that is made up from many transistors. This type of circuit most often has 2 inputs and only 1 output. These are the building blocks of any computer and helps perform, as the name suggest, logic for the computer. The most common types of logic gates would be the and gate, or gate, and not gate. </p>
